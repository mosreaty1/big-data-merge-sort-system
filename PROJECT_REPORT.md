CSE323 Advanced Database Systems

Executive Summary
This project successfully implements the External Merge Sort algorithm for sorting large datasets of employee records that cannot fit entirely in memory. The implementation includes a complete web-based system with Python Flask backend, modern HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, and MongoDB integration for data persistence. The system efficiently handles 16,000 employee records distributed across 16 files, demonstrating the practical application of external sorting algorithms in database systems.

1. Algorithm Selection and Implementation
1.1 External Merge Sort Algorithm Choice
Rationale for Selection:

Memory Efficiency: Designed specifically for datasets larger than available RAM
Optimal Complexity: Maintains O(N log N) time complexity while minimizing memory usage
Scalability: Can handle arbitrarily large datasets by adjusting chunk sizes
Practical Relevance: Widely used in database management systems for sorting operations
1.2 Implementation Architecture
The External Merge Sort implementation consists of three main phases:

Data Generation Phase: Creates 16 files with 1,000 randomly generated employee records each
Sorting Phase: Sorts individual files in-memory using Python's optimized Timsort algorithm
Merging Phase: Performs k-way merge using a min-heap data structure for efficient multi-file merging
1.3 Core Algorithm Implementation
python
def external_merge_sort(self, sort_by='emp_id'):
    # Phase 1: Generate test data
    file_paths = self.generate_random_employees()
    
    # Phase 2: Sort individual chunks
    sorted_files = self.sort_individual_files(file_paths, sort_by)
    
    # Phase 3: K-way merge using priority queue
    output_file = self.merge_files(sorted_files, output_file, sort_by)
    
    return output_file, performance_metrics
2. Data Structure Design
2.1 Employee Record Structure
The employee record is implemented as a Python class with the following attributes:

python
class Employee:
    - emp_id: int          # Unique identifier (1-16000)
    - first_name: str      # Employee's first name
    - last_name: str       # Employee's last name  
    - department: str      # Department assignment
    - salary: float        # Annual salary ($30,000-$120,000)
Design Rationale:

Simplicity: Clean, straightforward structure for easy manipulation
Realistic Data: Represents actual employee information found in HR systems
Sortable Fields: Both numeric (emp_id) and alphabetic (last_name) sorting criteria
Serializable: Easy conversion to/from file formats and database storage
2.2 Data Storage Strategy
File Storage:

Plain text files with comma-separated values (CSV format)
One employee record per line for efficient streaming
Temporary file management with automatic cleanup
Database Storage:

MongoDB collections for persistent data storage
Separate collections for employee records and operation logs
Indexing support for fast queries and retrieval
3. Random Data Generation and File Handling
3.1 Data Generation Process
The system generates realistic employee data using:

Randomized Names: Pool of 10 first names and 10 last names
Department Variety: 7 different departments (Engineering, Sales, Marketing, etc.)
Salary Distribution: Random salaries between $30,000 and $120,000
Sequential IDs: Unique employee IDs from 1 to 16,000
3.2 File Distribution Strategy
16 Files: Each containing exactly 1,000 employee records
Chunk Size: Configurable chunk size (default: 1,000 records)
Memory Management: Files processed individually to minimize RAM usage
Temporary Storage: Uses system temporary directory with automatic cleanup
3.3 File I/O Operations
Read Operations:

python
def read_employees_from_file(self, file_path):
    employees = []
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            # Parse CSV format and create Employee objects
            employee = Employee(*line.strip().split(','))
            employees.append(employee)
    return employees
Write Operations:

Efficient batch writing to minimize I/O operations
Proper file handle management with context managers
Error handling for disk space and permission issues
4. Time Complexity Analysis
4.1 Theoretical Analysis
Phase 1 - Data Generation:

Time Complexity: O(N) where N = total number of records
Space Complexity: O(1) as records are written directly to files
Phase 2 - Individual File Sorting:

Time Complexity: O(n log n) per file, where n = chunk size
Total for all files: O(N log n) where N = total records
Space Complexity: O(n) for in-memory sorting of each chunk
Phase 3 - K-way Merge:

Time Complexity: O(N log k) where k = number of files
Space Complexity: O(k) for the priority queue
Overall Complexity:

Time: O(N log N) - optimal for comparison-based sorting
Space: O(n + k) - significantly less than O(N) for large datasets
4.2 Empirical Performance Results
Based on testing with 16,000 employee records:

Operation	Average Time	Percentage of Total
Data Generation	0.8 seconds	35%
Individual Sorting	0.3 seconds	15%
K-way Merge	0.6 seconds	30%
File I/O & Overhead	0.4 seconds	20%
