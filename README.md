External Merge Sort for Large Employee Records
Project Overview
This project implements the External Merge Sort algorithm to efficiently sort large datasets of employee records that cannot fit entirely in memory. The system is designed as a full-stack web application with a Python Flask backend and a modern HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, using MongoDB for data persistence.

Features
External Merge Sort Algorithm: Implementation of k-way merge sort for large datasets
Employee Record Management: Complete CRUD operations for employee data
Web Interface: Modern, responsive UI for interacting with the sorting system
Performance Monitoring: Real-time tracking of sorting operations and time complexity
MongoDB Integration: Persistent storage of employee records and operation logs
Multi-criteria Sorting: Support for sorting by Employee ID or Last Name

Employee Record Structure
Each employee record contains the following fields:

Employee ID (integer): Unique identifier
First Name (string): Employee's first name
Last Name (string): Employee's last name
Department (string): Department assignment
Salary (float): Annual salary
Algorithm Implementation
External Merge Sort Process
Data Generation: Creates 16 files with 1,000 employee records each (16,000 total)
Individual Sorting: Sorts each file in-memory using Python's built-in sorting
K-way Merge: Merges all sorted files using a priority queue (heap) for efficient k-way merging
Result Storage: Outputs final sorted dataset
Time Complexity Analysis
Sorting Phase: O(n log n) for each chunk, where n = chunk size
Merging Phase: O(N log k) where N = total records, k = number of files
Overall Complexity: O(N log N) with optimal space usage
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
MongoDB account (MongoDB Atlas recommended)
Internet connection for package installation
Installation
Clone or Download the Project Files
bash
mkdir external-merge-sort
cd external-merge-sort
Create the Project Files
Copy app.py to the project directory
Create templates/ directory and copy index.html into it
Copy requirements.txt to the project directory
Install Python Dependencies
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure MongoDB Connection
The MongoDB connection string is already configured in app.py
No additional setup required for the provided MongoDB Atlas cluster
Run the Application
bash
python app.py
Access the Web Interface
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000

Usage Guide
Step 1: Generate Sample Data
Click "Generate Sample Data" to create 16,000 employee records
Data will be distributed across 16 files (1,000 records each)
Records are also stored in MongoDB for persistence
Step 2: Choose Sorting Criterion
Employee ID: Numerical sorting in ascending order
Last Name: Alphabetical sorting (case-insensitive)
Step 3: Execute External Merge Sort
Select your preferred sorting criterion
Click "Execute External Merge Sort"
Monitor the progress through the loading indicator
View results and performance metrics
Step 4: Analyze Results
Performance Metrics: View timing for each phase
Operations Log: Detailed breakdown of all operations
Sorted Results: Preview of the first 100 sorted records
API Endpoints
Data Management
POST /api/generate-data - Generate sample employee data
GET /api/employees - Retrieve employee records with pagination
DELETE /api/clear-data - Clear all data from the system
Sorting Operations
POST /api/sort - Execute external merge sort algorithm
GET /api/operations - Retrieve operation history and logs
Technical Implementation Details
External Merge Sort Class
The ExternalMergeSort class implements the core algorithm:

Chunk Management: Handles file I/O for large datasets
Memory Optimization: Uses temporary files to minimize RAM usage
K-way Merging: Employs a min-heap for efficient multi-file merging
Performance Tracking: Logs execution time for each operation
Database Schema
Employees Collection:

json
{
  "emp_id": 1,
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe", 
  "department": "Engineering",
  "salary": 75000.0
}
Operations Collection:

json
{
  "operation": "external_merge_sort_complete",
  "time_taken": 2.3456,
  "timestamp": "2025-05-24T10:30:00Z",
  "details": {"sort_by": "emp_id"}
}
Performance Benchmarks
Based on typical execution with 16,000 records:

Data Generation: ~0.5-1.0 seconds
Individual File Sorting: ~0.1-0.3 seconds
K-way Merge Phase: ~0.2-0.5 seconds
Total Processing Time: ~1.0-2.0 seconds
Advanced Features
Memory Management
Configurable chunk sizes for different memory constraints
Automatic cleanup of temporary files
Efficient file handling with proper resource management
Error Handling
Comprehensive exception handling throughout the application
User-friendly error messages in the web interface
Database connection resilience
Scalability Considerations
Modular design allows for easy scaling to larger datasets
Configurable parameters for different hardware configurations
Efficient MongoDB indexing for fast queries
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
MongoDB Connection Error
Verify internet connection
Check if the MongoDB cluster is accessible
Ensure no firewall blocking the connection
Port Already in Use
Change the port in app.py: app.run(port=5001)
Or stop any process using port 5000
Memory Issues with Large Datasets
Reduce chunk size in ExternalMergeSort.__init__()
Monitor system memory usage during execution
Performance Optimization
For larger datasets, consider increasing chunk size if memory allows
MongoDB indexing can be added for faster queries
Parallel processing can be implemented for sorting individual chunks
